Description: GpGp includes functions for reordering
    input locations, finding ordered nearest neighbors
    (with help from FNN package), grouping operations, 
    approximate likelihood evaluations, profile likelihoods,
    Gaussian process predictions, and conditional simulations.
    Covariance functions for spatial and spatial-temporal data
    on Euclidean domains and spheres are provided.
